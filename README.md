implement many robot generative (flow-matching) method for robot task.
1. much ado about noising (CMU) -- MIP.
2. state2action -- a flow matching method from state dist to action dist condition on image
3. L1/L2 loss pure BC metohd on Encoder-only (just multi layers MHA)/MLP model
4. Eular method flow matching method on MLP/Encoder-only/DiT model
5. Offline/O2O RL method/code is coming soon...
# install & Training 
comming soon....
but you can find the install pipeline and the requirements.txt in this repo: https://github.com/JinbiaoZhu/ACT_Implementation
